    <h1>THE FIRST FLIGHT</h1>
    <h2>The first commercial aviation flight in India took place on 18 February 1911. It was a brief demonstration
        flight of about 15 minutes from the United Provinces Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition in Allahabad,
        across the Yamuna River to Naini, a distance of 9.7 kilometres (6 mi). The aircraft, a Humber biplane 
        shipped from England specifically for the event, was flown by French aviator Henri Pequet and carried 6,500
        pieces of mail, making it the first official airmail service.</h2>
